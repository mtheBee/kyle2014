**Motivation:**  

My research examines the bidirectional relationship between sleep and emotional function, in particular how poor sleep influences and is influenced by impaired emotion processing and emotion regulation. Emotion perception is one process in a cascade of emotional responses that is impacted (van der Helm, Gujar, & Walker, 2010) by poor sleep and that has important consequences for social interactions. 

One of several recent papers examining how poor sleep harms social-emotional function, this 2014 study by Kyle and colleagues examines the differences between emotional face perception in a population with primary insomnia disorder (PI) compared to a control population of good sleepers. Interestingly, the authors did not find significant group differences in emotional face recognition among insomnia patients, contrary to findings (Franzen et al., 2009; Minkel et al., 2011; van der Helm et al., 2011) in sleep deprived subjects, although they did find differences in intensity ratings for low versus high arousal negative affect facial expressions in insomnia patients relative to controls. 

Given the study's underpowered sample size and given that the researchers noted differences in the distribution of intensity ratings for their stimuli, this paper seems ripe for replication with a broader online sample. My replication project can help determine whether insomnia indeed correlates with impaired emotional face perception, or whether this pattern of findings in the literature is better explained by concurrent (and likely insomnia-related) symptoms of mood disorders.

**Stimuli:** 

For the emotional face perception task, the stimuli will be 80 Ekman & Friesen faces (5 male, 5 female) displaying anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. The task requires that participants label each of the faces as angry, fearful, happy, or sad as quickly or accurately as possible. Following their response and a 500-ms delay, participants then rate the intensity of the face along a 7-point Likert scale.

For the Psychomotor Vigilance Task, participants must click a mouse as rapidly as possible when an asterisk appears on the screen. Asterisk onset varies randomly between 1 and 10 seconds. Reaction time is assessed. The PVT occurs for 110 trials.

All other stimuli are questionnaires: the Flinders Fatigue Scale (FFS), the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).


**Challenges:**

I will not be attempting to replicate the seven-day protocol pairing a sleep diary with polysomnography in order to assign participants to the insomnia or control groups; instead I will have to rely on single-time-point self-report surveys of insomnia severity and fatigue to categorize participants. I can also have participants fill out a single sleep diary entry for the previous night of sleep; although one night is not considered an especially valid measure of sleep, it may suffice.

To replicate this study, I will need to implement five parts of the study in Mechanical Turk: surveys of insomnia, fatigue, and daytime functioning; depression, distress, and anxiety self-report measures; a timed face recognition task with intensity ratings; and a reaction time measure (the Psychomotor Vigilance Task) in Amazon Mechanical Turk. I don't have any experience programming with Javascript, so I'm not sure how challenging implementing the face recognition and rating task and the PVT task will be. 

Another issue is that, in this paper, sleep and psychiatric disorders were assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview by a licensed clinician. Since this is an in-depth person interview, I may need to substitute other questionnaires to assess sleep and psychiatric symptoms or simply rely on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) self-report measure used in the study. I'm not sure if the HADS would be sufficient to capture below-clinical-level mood disorder or psychological distress symptoms.
